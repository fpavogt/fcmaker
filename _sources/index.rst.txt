fcmaker is a Python3 module that offers a rapid, easy and automated way to generate 
ESO-compliant finding charts for observing blocks (OBs) located on 
`p2 <http://www.eso.org/p2>`_. fcmaker relies on `p2api <https://www.eso.org/copdemo/apidoc/>`_ 
to easily interact with the `p2 <http://www.eso.org/p2>`_ database.

The design of the fcmaker finding charts is driven by their use at the VLT to support 
nighttime operations. They aim at providing a clear and accurate view of the expected 
execution of an OB, given its parameters **(i.e. without any further manual input)**. Note 
that unlike `p2 <http://www.eso.org/p2>`_, fcmaker does **not** perform any validation 
checks on the OB: it merely prints what they do, be it valid or not. **In essence, fcmaker 
is intended to provide the user with the ability to visually check the content of an OB.**   

I expect/hope that fcmaker, despite being fully automated, will do a reasonable job for 
most OBs of the supported instruments and modes. Should you stumble upon a case where
fcmaker utterly fails to do something useful/elegant, `I'd be keen to know about it 
<frederic.vogt@alumni.anu.edu.au>`_.

.. note::

   The *operational spirit* of fcmaker implies that, at times, its finding charts may 
   not be the most ideal to **design and prepare** an OB. 
   
   For example, fcmaker voluntarily does not display the SGS area for MUSE WFM 
   observations. Whereas it may be important at the design phase to ensure that a given
   SGS star can be accessible in all the OB steps, it is irrelevant for the execution
   of the OB itself, and would unnecessarily crowd the fcmaker finding charts.
   
   From that perspective, fcmaker is very much complementary to the `GUideCam Tool (GUCT) <https://www.eso.org/sci/observing/phase2/SMGuidelines/GUCT.generic.html>`_. 

.. warning::
   fcmaker is developed by an ESO Fellow with duties at the VLT: initially, to meet his own 
   observational needs. It is shared publicly with the community, in the hope 
   that it can be useful to others. 
   
   But please note that **fcmaker is not supported or officially endorsed by the 
   European Southern Observatory!**
   
   **As such, you should never blindly rely on what fcmaker does!** If the finding 
   chart generated by fcmaker looks different from what you expected, this means that:
   
   1) there is a real design flaw in your OB, or
   2) there is a yet undiscovered bug in fcmaker.
      
   In those discordant cases, `feedback <frederic.vogt@alumni.anu.edu.au>`_ will be greatly 
   appreciated.
